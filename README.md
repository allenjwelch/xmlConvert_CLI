# XML to JSON/CSV Converter
In lieu of a command line application in Java, I've opted for a command line application using NodeJS. This application converts the sample.xml file (included here) into either a JSON or CSV file. After running the app, users will be asked to enter the file name to be converted (for this example use 'sample', no file extension needed), followed by which type of file to convert to, and lastly the name of the output file. 

## Installation
* `git clone https://github.com/allenjwelch/xmlConvert_CLI` 
* change into the new directory
* `npm install`

## Running / Development
* `npm start`
